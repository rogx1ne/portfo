You are an expert Full-Stack Developer specializing in:
- Next.js (App Router, latest version)
- TypeScript
- Three.js
- Barba.js (or a Barba-like page transition layer)
- Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for styling and animations

YOUR TASK:
Build a **fully animated, Gen-Z dark rave themed personal portfolio website** for me using **Next.js + TypeScript + Three.js + Barba.js**. The design must be **clean, unique, and highly polished**, not a generic template.

====================================
1. PROJECT SETUP
====================================
- Use **Next.js App Router** (in `app/` directory) with **TypeScript**.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Use **Framer Motion** for component-level animations.
- Use **Three.js** for 3D visuals in the hero/landing section.
- Integrate **Barba.js**-style page transitions (or implement equivalent route transitions in Next.js using Framer Motion, but structure it like a Barba transition layer).
- Set up a clean project structure, for example:

  - `app/`
    - `layout.tsx`
    - `page.tsx` (Home)
    - `about/page.tsx`
    - `projects/page.tsx`
    - `experience/page.tsx`
    - `contact/page.tsx`
  - `components/`
    - `Navbar.tsx`
    - `Footer.tsx`
    - `Hero.tsx`
    - `SectionWrapper.tsx`
    - `ProjectCard.tsx`
    - `TimelineItem.tsx`
    - `SkillsCloud.tsx`
    - `ThreeScene.tsx` (Three.js scene)
    - `PageTransition.tsx` (Barba-style transitions)
  - `lib/`
    - `data.ts` (all portfolio data config)
  - `styles/` (global styles if needed)
  - `public/` (assets)

====================================
2. CONTENT & SECTIONS
====================================
The portfolio should have these core sections/pages:

1) HOME / LANDING
   - Hero section with:
     - Name: `[YOUR_NAME]`
     - Short role/title: `[Your Role e.g. "Full-Stack Developer & BCA Student"]`
     - Short tagline: `[1–2 line punchy intro]`
   - A strong **3D / Three.js background**:
     - Dark rave vibe: neon shapes, particles, maybe a rotating abstract object.
   - Animated call-to-action buttons:
     - “View Projects”
     - “Contact Me”
   - Subtle parallax and hover effects.

2) ABOUT
   - Short bio describing:
     - Education: `[BCA, Arcade Business College, Year]`
     - Location: `[Your City, Country]`
     - Interests: web dev, JS/TS, React, Node, DevOps, etc.
   - Timeline or small “storyline” of how I got into tech.
   - A few highlight stats/cards (e.g. “3+ Major Projects”, “Tech Stack: JS/TS/React/Node”, etc).

3) SKILLS
   - Categorized skills:
     - Programming: `C, C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript`
     - Web: `HTML, CSS, React, Next.js`
     - Backend: `Node.js, Express`
     - Tools/Other: `Git, Linux, etc.`
   - Use a **visual/animated layout**:
     - e.g. a rotating “skills cloud” or grid with hover animations.
   - Each skill should have:
     - Name
     - Skill level (e.g. bar or dots)
     - Optional small description tooltip.

4) PROJECTS
   - Cards for each project, with data coming from `lib/data.ts`.
   - For each project:
     - title: string
     - description: short paragraph
     - techStack: string[]
     - githubUrl?: string
     - liveUrl?: string
     - highlightTag?: string (e.g. “Featured”, “New”)
   - Design:
     - Animated project cards with hover effects (tilt, glow).
     - Filter/chip buttons to filter by tech tags (e.g. React, Next.js, Node).
   - Optionally, clicking a project opens a detailed modal with more info.

5) EXPERIENCE / EDUCATION
   - A vertical **timeline** for:
     - Education (BCA, college details).
     - Any internships/experience (can use placeholders for now).
   - Use card + timeline style:
     - Year / duration
     - Role / Course
     - Organization name and location
     - Short description of responsibilities/what I learned.

6) CONTACT
   - Contact form:
     - name, email, message.
   - Basic validation on client side.
   - For now, you can just log the data in console or set up a dummy API route.
   - Also include:
     - Email link: `[your_email@example.com]`
     - Github link: `[your_github_url]`
     - LinkedIn link: `[your_linkedin_url]`
   - Animated submit button + success/error states.

====================================
3. THEME & VISUAL STYLE (GEN-Z DARK RAVE)
====================================
Overall mood: **dark, neon, cyberpunk / rave** but still clean and readable.

- Background:
  - Dark gradient backgrounds (deep blacks, purples, blues).
  - Subtle animated noise or gradient shift if possible (low-key, not distracting).
- Colors:
  - Base: #020617 / #050816 or similar very dark gray/black.
  - Accents: neon pink, purple, teal, electric blue.
  - Use accent glows for buttons, borders, and hover states.
- Typography:
  - Use a modern sans-serif font, plus an optional edgy display font for headings.
  - Maintain good readability: clear hierarchy for headings, body, and captions.
- UI Elements:
  - Glowing borders, soft shadows, glassmorphism panels in some sections.
  - Custom cursor (slightly larger circle with hover effects).
  - Neon underlines on hover for links & nav items.

====================================
4. ANIMATION & INTERACTION
====================================
- Use **Framer Motion** for:
  - Page section entrances (fade + slide).
  - Staggered animations for lists (skills, projects, timeline).
  - Hover/tap animations for buttons and cards.
- Use **Barba-style transitions** for navigating between pages:
  - On route change:
    - Animate current page out (fade, slide, scale, or glitch effect).
    - Animate new page in with a smooth transition.
  - Use a central `PageTransition` wrapper component to handle this.
- Smooth scroll behavior between sections on the Home page.
- On hover:
  - Buttons: slight scale-up, glow effect, maybe a subtle rotation.
  - Cards: parallax tilt, shadow + glow.

====================================
5. THREE.JS SECTION
====================================
Implement a **Three.js powered hero background**:

- A dedicated `ThreeScene.tsx` component that:
  - Renders an abstract 3D object (e.g., torus knot, spheres, shapes).
  - Uses neon-like emissive materials.
  - Has slow, continuous animation (rotation, camera movement).
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame and responsive canvas.
- Make sure Three.js canvas:
  - Is behind hero content with proper z-index.
  - Is performance-friendly (optimize lights, object count).

====================================
6. NAVIGATION & LAYOUT
====================================
- Sticky top **Navbar** with:
  - Logo / Name (e.g. `[AJ]` or `[Your Initials]`).
  - Nav links: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact.
  - Mobile menu (hamburger) with an animated open/close.
- **Footer**:
  - Simple, minimal with name, year, and short message.
  - Links to Github/LinkedIn.

- Layout should be:
  - Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Consistent paddings and margins.
  - Proper containers and max-width for content.

====================================
7. DATA CONFIG & CUSTOMIZATION
====================================
- All my portfolio data (name, tagline, skills, projects, experience, links) should be kept in a single **TypeScript config file**: `lib/data.ts`.
- Example structures:

  - `export const heroData = { name, title, tagline, buttons: [...] }`
  - `export const skills = [{ category, items: [...] }]`
  - `export const projects = [{ title, description, techStack, githubUrl, liveUrl, highlightTag }]`
  - `export const experience = [{ type: "education" | "work", title, org, period, description }]`

- Use these configs to drive all UI, so I can easily edit them later without touching component logic.

====================================
8. CODE QUALITY & BEST PRACTICES
====================================
- Use **TypeScript** strictly with proper types/interfaces for all data.
- Break down UI into reusable components.
- Keep components clean and avoid huge files.
- Use meaningful names for components and props.
- Add comments where logic is non-trivial (e.g., Three.js, transitions).
- No dead code, minimal console logs (only where needed for demo).

====================================
9. FINAL DELIVERABLE
====================================
At the end, ensure:
- The app compiles and runs with `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`).
- All pages are reachable from the navbar.
- The main features are working:
  - Animated hero with Three.js.
  - Smooth page transitions (Barba-style).
  - Interactive skills and projects sections.
  - Contact form with basic validation.
- Provide any quick notes in a README or comments about:
  - How to modify data in `lib/data.ts`.
  - Where to adjust theme colors and animations.

Build the entire portfolio now according to this specification.
